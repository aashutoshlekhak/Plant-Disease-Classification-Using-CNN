# Potato Disease Classification App

This Streamlit app classifies potato diseases using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting potato diseases based on input images. The trained model can classify images into three classes: Potato Early blight, Potato Late blight, and Potato healthy.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Plant Village dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) available on Kaggle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
